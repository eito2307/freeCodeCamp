Step 12 Passed

You can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a p element.
Example Code

<p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>

In the text of your p element, turn the words cat photos into a link by adding opening and closing anchor (a) tags around these words. Then set the href attribute to https://freecatphotoapp.com
