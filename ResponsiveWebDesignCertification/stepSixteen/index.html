Step 16 Passed

Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.

The section element is used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. It is a semantic element that helps with SEO and accessibility.
Example Code

<section>
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <p>Section content...</p>
</section>

Take your h2, comment, p, and anchor (a) elements and nest them in a section element.
